Commands and their uses
# satellite-maintain service status 
# satellite-maintain service restart

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To manage the satelitte server need to know three inmortant things incontent 
1. lifecycle environments
2. content view
3. Activation keys 
So for satelitte customer licence is attached to satelitte so what ever the licence we have it will be tacken from the 
redhat portal 
we can see the licence subscription in content 
Total NO. OF LICENCE how many are there and how many licence are been consumed 
Now in --> Hosts --> Content Hosts 
will list all the servers subscribed to satelitte 
if we have any patching activity for any other servers then we need to unregistere the subscription

1. lifecycle environments

Once the Redhat satelitte is been created there after need to create lifecycle environment 
Which is nothing but a group created for a repositories like 
RHEL 7 server rpm 
RHEL 7 optional RPM 
RHEL 7 supplimentory RPM 
for that need to create a envronmental group like for cloude we crated Cloud as a group
 
2. content view
Nothing but synconysing the latest packages to the satelitte server 
Lets say we have RHEL 7.8 repos in our system and you want latest packages to be in RHEL 7 
So we get the latest packages by synking the repo 
In the same way here we do content view helps us to synk the latest packages from redhat portal by clicking publish new 
IN the same way we can allocate any version to any server by clicking on promotion option in content view 

Synk Plan
--------- 
For every quater we need to patch the server for that we dont want to do manually 
we have synk plan at different intervals of time like daily, weekly, monthly or perticular 

3. Activation keys 
This makes a comunication between the satelitte server to client server 
To check the activation key of environment(group) with content view by clicking on the name of listed activation key 
we can check the existing key for every activation key 
so now go to the perticular server 
First we need to do 
# subscription-manager clear (So that it will remoe all the existing subscription )
# yum clean all
# <past the subscription key> --force (subscription coplete)
# yum clean all && yum repolist 
# yum list update (to check the latest updates)

Let check in the satelitte portal 
Hosts--> content hosts ---> search with the server name 
so then the server is available in the satelitte server 
To check the package which is assigned to server is 

repository sets-> limint to lifecycle environment
here the enable status will get to know any patch is available are not 


*---Day today activities in satelitte----
1. licence clearing 
for example every day we have to do 10 servers for patching so today we did 10 servers means already servers are connected
with satelitte and next day for another 10 servers need to do patching means we have to remove the servers from the satelitte
2. if the customer is not interested in quaerly patching and depends on the customer demant need to patch the server immediatly 
so in this case 
we canot depend upon the synk plan 
need to go to the content view --> public version 
we can manually synk it to the latest version and then we can patch the version 
3. creating content view if already created no need to create 
adding name, addinig specific repos, and synk it.

---major issues related to satelitte server-
Issue 1
In redhat satelitte there will be one dir /var 

# /var or /var/lib/pulb ( stores the repositories here) wecanalso customise this file 
this folder should have enough space 
this /var folder will get full as keep on storing all the repositorie packages will store in /var further leads filling 100%
of /var and leads server get hang 
So in order to over come this issue  
need to extent the space of /var but required downtime 
# satellite-maintain service stop (need to stop all the services related to satelitte)
Then we can extend the file system and after we can stat the service 
# satellite-maintain service restart
or 
we can delete older versions by going to the [content view--->open any version and delete unwanted version] but not recomended 

Issue 2
Some times 
we face licence issue even after registering like subscription manager fails to register and the reason will be 
THis satelitte server will have direct internet access with redhat portal so some times looses its connection 
where we have manage manifest in content--> subscription 
here licence file is attach here once the licence is provide by the Redhat and contains all the licence of our satelitte
so file will loose its connection from portal and the satelitte and there fore 
non of the servers will try to synk or get registered 
To rectify this by clicking on refrest botton again the connection will be established 


-----Client----------
Is there any package or service need to be installed 
Yes katello is the packege to be installed where it will acts like a agent between satelitte server to client server
---> register content host wiil see all the steps how to install 
to check weathert he package is installedor not 
# rpm -qa | grep katello 
in rehat repositories we can able to know available repos and enabled repos
