-----User admin--------
To create a user 
# useradd user1 or adduser user1
To delete created user 
# userdel -r user1

# id <user name>
# userdel <user name>
To modify the created user 
# usermod -u user2 user1 
user arkitecture will have total  fields 7 
# user:x:1002:1002:user,500,33,35,44:/home/sagar:bin/bash
 
# vi /etc/passwd 
#  Sreedhar:x:1000:1000:Vivek Gite:/home/vivek:/bin/bash
it has 7 fields 	 
1. Username: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length. 
2. Password: An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. 
   Please note that you need to use the passwd command to computes the hash of a password typed at 
   the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file
3. User ID (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and
   UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system 
   for administrative and system accounts/groups.
4. Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)
5. User ID Info (GECOS): The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such 
   as userâ€™s full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command.
6. Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. 
   If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /
7. Command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. 
   Please note that it does not have to be a shell. For example, sysadmin can use the nologin shell, 
   which acts as a replacement shell for the user accounts. If shell set to /sbin/nologin and the user 
   tries to log in to the Linux system directly, the /sbin/nologin shell closes the connection.
