Q. What is LVM?
A. Logical Volume Management enables the combining of multiple individual hard drives
   and/or disk partitions into a single volume group (VG). That volume group can then 
   be subdivided into logical volumes (LV) or used as a single large logical volume where 
   we can increase or shrink the Logicle volume

Q. What is selinux?
Q. selinux
A. Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux® systems 
   that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. 
   It was originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) 
   as a series of patches to the Linux kernel using Linux Security Modules (LSM)
Configuration file: 
# /etc/selinux/confif
there are three modes:
1. enforsing will have full security
2. permissive - no security will have a worning msg
3. disable - no security
commands:
# getenforce (single line information)
# sestatus   ( more information)
to chNGE THE Security
# vi /etc/selinux/config
change 
SELINUX= enforsing or permissive or disable
-------------------------------------Booting process----------------------------------------------
Booting process0
6 Stages of Linux Boot Process (Startup Sequence)
1. BIOS
2. MBR
3. GRUB(6 and 7 will differ)
4. Kernel
5. Init
6. Runlevel programs
#BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System
Performs some system integrity checks
Searches, loads, and executes the boot loader program.
It looks for boot loader in floppy, cd-rom, or hard drive. You can press a key 
(typically F12 of F2, but it depends on your system) during the BIOS startup to change
the boot sequence.Once the boot loader program is detected and loaded into the memory,
BIOS gives the control to it.So, in simple terms BIOS loads and executes the MBR boot loader.
#2. MBR
MBR stands for Master Boot Record.
It is located in the 1st sector of the bootable disk. Typically /dev/hda, or /dev/sda
MBR is less than 512 bytes in size. This has three components 
1) primary boot loader info in 1st 446 bytes 
2) partition table info in next 64 bytes 
3) mbr validation check in last 2 bytes.
It contains information about GRUB (or LILO in old systems).
So, in simple terms MBR loads and executes the GRUB boot loader.
#3. GRUB
GRUB stands for Grand Unified Bootloader.
If you have multiple kernel images installed on your system, you can 
choose which one to be executed.GRUB displays a splash screen, waits 
for few seconds, if you don’t enter anything, it loads the default kernel image
as specified in the grub configuration file.GRUB has the knowledge of the filesystem
(the older Linux loader LILO didn’t understand filesystem).
Grub configuration file is /boot/grub/grub.conf (/etc/grub.conf is a link to this).
The following is sample grub.conf of CentOS.
As you notice from the above info, it contains kernel and initrd image.
So, in simple terms GRUB just loads and executes Kernel and initrd images.
#4. Kernel
Mounts the root file system as specified in the “root=” in grub.conf
Kernel executes the /sbin/init program
Since init was the 1st program to be executed by Linux Kernel, it has the process id (PID)
 of 1. Do a ‘ps -ef | grep init’ and check the pid.
initrd stands for Initial RAM Disk.
initrd is used by kernel as temporary root file system until kernel is booted and
the real root file system is mounted. It also contains necessary drivers
compiled inside, which helps it to access the hard drive partitions, and other hardware.
#5. Init
Looks at the /etc/inittab file to decide the Linux run level.
Following are the available run levels
0 – halt
1 – Single user mode
2 – Multiuser, without NFS
3 – Full multiuser mode
4 – unused
5 – X11
6 – reboot
Init identifies the default initlevel from /etc/inittab and uses that to load all 
appropriate program.Execute ‘grep initdefault /etc/inittab’ on your system to identify
the default run levelIf you want to get into trouble, you can set the default run level
to 0 or 6. Since you know what 0 and 6 means, probably you might not do that.
Typically you would set the default run level to either 3 or 5.
#6. Runlevel programs
When the Linux system is booting up, you might see various services getting started. 
For example, it might say “starting sendmail …. OK”. Those are the runlevel programs,
 executed from the run level directory as defined by your run level.
Depending on your default init level setting, the system will execute the programs 
from one of the following directories.
Run level 0 – /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/
Run level 1 – /etc/rc.d/rc1.d/
Run level 2 – /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/
Run level 3 – /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
Run level 4 – /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/
Run level 5 – /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/
Run level 6 – /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/
Please note that there are also symbolic links available for these directory 
under /etc directly. So, /etc/rc0.d is linked to /etc/rc.d/rc0.d.
Under the /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/ directories, you would see programs that start with S and K.
Programs starts with S are used during startup. S for startup.
Programs starts with K are used during shutdown. K for kill.
There are numbers right next to S and K in the program names. 
Those are the sequence number in which the programs should be started or killed.
For example, S12syslog is to start the syslog deamon, which has the sequence number of 12. 
S80sendmail is to start the sendmail daemon, which has the sequence number of 80.
So, syslog program will be started before sendmail.
There you have it. That is what happens during the Linux boot process.

   4. z shell
   5. Bourne again shell(bash)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is Hyper-v?
A. Hyper-V is Microsoft's hardware virtualization product. It lets you create and run a 
   software version of a computer, called a virtual machine. Each virtual machine acts 
   like a complete computer, running an operating system and programs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. 7 layers of osi Model
A. An OSI model consists of seven different layers which are typically described from
   the top to bottom. In order from seven to one, the layers are as follows: 
  7. application -------> End user Layer: HTTP, FTP, IRC, SSH, DNS,
  6. presentation-------> Syntax Layer ssl, SSH, IMAP, FTP, MPEG, JPEG.
  5. session -----------> synk and sent to port PI's, sockets, WInsockets,
  4. transport----------> End to end connections, TCP,UDP
  3. network------------> packets: IP, ICMP, IPsec, IGMP
  2. data link----------> Frames: Ethernet, PPP, Switch, Bridge.
  1. and physical-------> Physical Structure: Fiber, Wireless, Hubs, Repeaters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Diference bitween layer 2 and layer 3 switches?
A.Layer 2 Switch:(data link layer)
   -Works with MAC address only 
   -it can communicate with single private network
   -Unmanaged switches
   -most famelier with Ethernet, means devices in a ethernet network are identified by MAC
  Layer 3 Switch(network layer)
   -Can perform functioning of both 2 layer and 3 layer switch
   -it can communicate with different private networks by configuring VLAN.
   -it is network layer and protocall is internet protocol
   -Layer 3 switches are managing routing table
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. can we replace layer 3 switch as a router?
A. it is not recommended to replace a router with layer 3 switch, but you can apply them in the same network at the same 
   time.
   A layer 3 switch is both a switch and a router: it can be regarded as a router 
   with multiple Ethernet ports and with switching function. layer 3 switch 
   enable packets switching by inspecting both their IP addresses and their MAC addresses.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. NIC-Network interface bonding?
A. Network Interface Bonding is a mechanism used in Linux servers which consists 
   of binding more physical network interfaces in order to provide more bandwidth than
   a single interface can provide or provide link redundancy in case of a cable failure.
or  
   Network bonding is a process of combing or joining two or more network interfaces 
   together into a single interface. Network bonding offers performance improvements 
   and redundancy by increasing the network throughput and bandwidth. If one interface 
   is down or unplugged the other one will work.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. MAC ip?
A. A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a 
   network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications 
   within a network segment.
   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What are the default permissions to the file and directory
A. To the dir 777 and to file 666
with umask  
root(022) dir-755, file-644
user(002) dir-775, flle-664
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How to check the locked user/root
A. Config /etc/shadow
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. how to unlock and lock user.
A. To Lock user    # usermod -L username
   To Unlock user  # usermod -U username
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How to find the type of os vertion in linux
A. /etc/os-relese
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. HOw to check the load Average/ server performance
A. uptime is the command
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. default full permissions to which directory?
A. /temp
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Inodes?
A. Inodes store information about files and directories (folders), such as file 
   ownership, access mode (read, write, execute permissions), and file type. 
   On many older file system implementations, the maximum number of inodes is fixed 
   at file system creation, limiting the maximum number of files the file system can hold.
--OR--
   An inode is a data structure in UNIX operating systems that contains important 
information pertaining to files within a file system. When a file system is created in 
UNIX, a set amount of inodes is created, as well. Usually, about 1 percent of the total 
file system disk space is allocated to the inode table. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is Zombi process.
A. Zombie processes in Linux are sometimes also referred to as defunct or dead processes.
   They're processes that have completed their execution, but their entries are not 
   removed from the process table
To find the Zombi process
# top -b1 -n1 | grepz
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is iostate?
A. The iostat command is used for monitoring system input/output device loading by 
   observing the time the devices are active in relation to their average transfer rates. 
   The iostat command generates reports that can be used to change system configuration 
   to better balance the input/output load between physical disks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
-------------------------------------TOP- detailinig(CPU)------------------------------------------
TOP:
 PID    Process ID
 USER   Owner of the process ie., which user executed that process
 PR     Dynamic Priority
 NI     Nice value, also known as base value
 VIRT   Virtual size of the task includes the size of processes executable binary
 RES    The size of RAM currently consumed by the task and not included the swap portion
 SHR    Shared memory area by two or more tasks
 S      Task Status
 % CPU  The % of CPU time dedicated to run the task and it is dynamically changed
 % MEM  The % of memory currently consumed by the task
 TIME+  The total CPU time the task has been used since it started. + sign means it is displayed 
        with hundredth of a second granularity. By default, TIME/TIME+ does not account the 
        CPU time used by the task's dead children
 COMMAND- Showing program name or process name.

Q. what is SMTP?
A. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, and it's an application used by 
   mail servers to send, receive, and/or relay outgoing mail between email senders 
   and receivers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. what is SNMP?
A. Although the original purpose of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
   was to let network administrators remotely manage an Internet system, the design 
   of SNMP lets network administrators manage applications and systems. SNMP provides 
   the following capabilities: Hides the underlying system network.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Difference bitweentn SMTP and SNMP?
A. SNMP and SMTP are two standards that work together in harmony to achieve two 
   different tasks. They work in such a way that one can control SMTP servers and MTAs 
   through SNMP Managers. Further, SNMP Managers are capable of sending alerts through 
   SMTP mail servers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
Q. What is DHCP and explain it?
A. DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. DHCP is a network protocol that enables the server 
   to assign an IP addresses to the clients in the network automatically from a defined range of IP addresses ie., 
   scope configured for a given network
   DHCP-Configuration file- /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf(dhcpd-Daemon)
   to check the dynamic IP address from the DHCP servers is /var/libdhcpd/dhcpd.example
   fixed address should be set in DHCP configaration file so that client wil get fixed IP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------RAID------------------------------------------------
Q. What is RAID? What is the use of the RAID and how many types of RAIDs available?
A. RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks.
   It provides fault tolerance, load balancing using stripping, mirroring and parity concepts.
   There are mainly two types of RAIDs available.
   (i) Hardware RAID (Depends on vendors and also more expensive)
   (ii) Software RAID (Does not depends on vendors and less expensive when compared to 
   Hardware RAID and also it is maintained by system administrator only.
   
Q. How many types of software RAIDs available and their requirements?
  (i)   RAID - 0 ---- Stripping ---- Minimum 2 disks required--
  (ii)  RAID - 1 ---- Mirroring ---- Minimum 2 disks required
  (iii) RAID - (1+0) ---Mirroring + Stripping ---- Minimum 4 disks required
  (iv)  RAID - (0+1) --- Stripping + Mirroring ---- Minimum 4 disks required
  (v)   RAID - 5 ---- Stripping with distributed parity ---- Minimum 3 disks required
  (VI)  RAID - 6 -----stripping with dual distributed parity 
  (VII) RAID - 10(1+0) -----striping with mirror ---minimum 4 disks 
  
Q. How to configure RAID - 0 in Linux? 
● To configure RAID - 0, minimum 2 disks are required and the partition id is "fd".
● Reading and writing is very fast. So, it produces high performance.
● if one disk is failed we cannot recover the data.
● So, there is no redundancy and fault tolerance in RAID - 0.
Example : For example if the data is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 then ....
       1 2
       3 4
       5 6
       7 8
Double the data to be consumed 
	   
Q.How to configure RAID - 1 in Linux?
● To configure RAID - 1, minimum 2 disks are required and the partition id is "fd".
● In this the same data will be written on 2 disks ie., exact copy on both the disks.
● if one disk is failed we can recover the data from another disk.
● So, there is a high availability, redundancy and fault tolerance in RAID - 1.
● In this writing speed is slow compared to RAID - 0.
Example : For example if the data is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 then ....
  1  1
  2  2
  3  3
  4  4
  5  5
  6  6
Same size will be consumed 
  
Q.How to configure RAID - 5 in Linux?
● To configure RAID - 5, minimum 3 disks are required and the partition id is "fd".
● In every disk approximately 25 - 30% of space is reserved for parity.
● Reading and writing is very fast. So, it produces high performance.
● This is used Stripping with parity concept.
● if one disk is failed we can recover the data using remaining two disks and parity.
● If two disks are failed, then we cannot recover the data.
● So, there is no redundancy and fault tolerance in RAID - 5.
Example : For example if the data is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 then ....
1     2    1+2
3+4   3    4
6     5+6  5
data will be consumed as per the formula n-1 

Q. I have four disks each 1TB in RAID - (1+0). So, total how much disk space can I utilize in that RAID - (1+0)?
A. RAID - (1+0) means Mirroring + Stripping. It requires 4 disks, ie., 2 disks for mirroring and remaining 2 disks for 
   stripping. And 5 - 10% disk space is used for superblock information. So, finally we can utilize 2TB - 2TB X 10% 
   disk space in that RAID - (1+0).
   
Q. If two disks failed in RAID - (1+0), can we recover the data?
A. The RAID - (1+0) requires minimum 4 disks and it uses Mirroring + Stripping. If one disk is failed we can recover 
   the data, but if two disks are failed we cannot recover the data
