--------------------------------------Net working--------------------------------------------------------
In RHEL7 the default networking service is provided by networking manager which is dynamic network control
and configuration daemon
user canot directly interact with network manager , instead user perform network configuration task via 
graphical and command line user interface tools 
The fallowing tools are available in RHELv7
1. nmtui ( it is a cursor based text user interface tool
2. nmcli ( its a command line interdace, it is provided to allow users to interact with network manager)
now go to RHEL server
To check how many ethernet network connections are there
# nmcli connection show | grep ethernet
will show only one ethernet device if we wnat to add one more network #poweroff and go to network>bridge network
# nmcli device status | grep ethernet
now will show one more ethernet device disconnected status
now we are going to add static ethernet connection
# nmcli connection add type ethernet con-name enp0s8 ifname enp0s8 ip4 192.168.1.130/24
# nmcli connection show | grep ethernet 
# ip addr
Suppose tochange the ip address of a network connections 
# nmcli connection modify enp0s8 ipv4.addresses 192.168.3.130/24
# nmcli connection modify enp0s8 ipv4.method manual 
# nmcli connection up enp0s8
above three commands will help to change the network connections
let us verify ip connectivity
# ip addr 
------------------------
Another method of changing r setting ip address
# cd/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
# vi ifcfg-enp0s8
TYPE=Ethernet
IPADDR=192.168.3.200
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NAME=enp0s8
UUID=bc**
DEVICE=enp0s8
ONBOOT=yes
(save)
# system restart network
# ip addr
* if we want to delete a connection 
# nmcli connection delete enp0s8 
* if we want to configure DNS address/ to change DNS address
# nmcli connection modify enp0s3 ipv4.dns "192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8"
# systemctl restart network
# cat /etc/resolv.conf
How to configure host name 
# nmcli general hostname rhelserver.wipro.com
# systemctl restart systemd-hostnamed
To verify
# hostnamectl
# vi /etc/hosts
last line 
192.168.0.130 rhelserver.wipro.com rhelserver
similarly we can also give ip address to the client in the same file next 
192.168.0.150 rhelclient.wipro.com rhelclient 
save (escape :qw!) 
nowwe can ping with name 
# ping rhelclient (chect the client to be powerd on and ping command uses ICMP internet controm messaging protocol))
If ICMP is blocked then ping command will not work
or 
# traceroute google.co.in (viawhich packet is going we can see)
To check weather DNS server is working properly 
# nslookup google.co.in
---------------------MAC-media access control address(48 bit hexa desimal number)-------------------------
# arp -a (to check the mac addrss reolved ) 
# netstat -nr (to check weather routing table tis fine )
# netstat -i (to check the network stat of interfaces)
 
-------------------------------Firewall cmd--------------------------------------------
 Firewall cmd
 A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network 
 traffic and permits or blocks data packets based on a set of security rules. 
 Its purpose is to establish a barrier between your internal network and incoming 
 traffic from external sources (such as the internet) in order to block malicious 
 traffic like viruses and hackers.
IP tables and fire walls is the same but options are different uses the netfilter from the
kernal mode 
# systemctl stop iptables 
# systemctl mask iptables 
# systemctl mask ip6tables
# systemctl status iptables
How to configure firewall 
# yum install -y firewalld firewall-configure
(if it is not enabled need to enable)
# systemctl status firewalld.service 
(to enable the service)
# systemctl enable firewalld.service 
To get the default zone of firewall)
# friewall-cmd --get-default-zone 
To set zone)
# friewall-cmd --set-default-zone=public 
To list the total active zones)
# friewall-cmd --get-active-zone 
To list the zone interface)
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-interface 
To add the interface )
  
To remove the interface )
# firewall-cmd --remove-interface=ens33 --zone=public 
To list all the services)
# firewall-cmd --get-services 
To list the services in a zone)
# firewall-cmd --list-all 
To add port to the fire wall
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=<88/tcp> 
To add the port to the other zone 
# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp
# firewall-cmd --reload
To list posts
# firewall-cmd --list-ports 
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
To add service to the specified zone and after need to reload the server
# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
To farward the port to other port adding rich rule
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule "rule family=ipv4 source addressrule <0.0.0.0/3> forward-port port=2080 protocol=tcp to port=80"
To block entire inbond and out bond services
# firewall-cmd --panic-on
To unblock the entire inbond and out bond services
# firewall-cmd --panic-off

Q. selinux-# getsebool -a |grep httpd (will reflect policies)
A. Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for LinuxÂ® systems 
   that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. 
   It was originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) 
   as a series of patches to the Linux kernel using Linux Security Modules (LSM)
Configuration file: 
# /etc/selinux/confif
there are three modes:
1. 1-enforsing will have full security
2. 0-permissive - no security will have a worning msg
3. disable - no security
commands:
# getenforce (single line information)
# sestatus   ( more information)
to chnge the Security
# vi /etc/selinux/config
change 
SELINUX= enforsing or permissive or disable
wq! (next need to reboot the sever then only the changes will reflect)
SELINUX policies 
# getsebool -a |grep httpd (will reflect policies)
To set change the policies 
# getsebool -P <past the policy by listing above command>=1 (binery 1 is on & for off 0)
To check the changes 
# getsebool -a |grep httpd
-------to change the SELINUX temperory --------------
# setenforse 0 
0 permissive
1 enforsing

----------------------------------------Break the root password-------------------------------------------
How to break the root password/if we do not know the ROOT password
Initially we need to poweroff the machine 
Lets power it on again and when the boot menu comes press e (e for editing)
go to the line which starts with 
linux16
then go to the end of the line by pressing end key 
now give space and type 

\rd.break
we have to boot the machine by pressing "ctlx" 
now we need to remount the root file system on /sysroot dir in read write mode 
# mount -o remount,rw /sysroot 
next switch ro /sysroot dir 
#chroot /sysroot 
now we canchange the password by fallowing command 
# echo Sree@123 | passwd root --stdin (enter) 
now we have to fourse selinux to reliable all the root file system
# touch /.autorelabel(enter after "ctld" 2 times)
hen takes time to to redirect to login screen and can log in with new password by clicking on not listed  

  
--------------------------------------arp-----------------------------------------------
arp stands for address resolution protocol this protocol is used by the network systems
to match IP address to MAC address 
Facilities to determine physical address while sending packet
Answering request for other machines
How it works:-
It uses local cache to Mac IP addresses to MAC addresses
If remote machine is known mac address is placed in frame and sent
If not Known, Broadcast will be sent and wait for reply
Target machines recognises packet its own address send the answers
Aarp comment will provide below information
 address-( IP address)
 HW type-( hardware type)
 HW address-( m a c address)
 Flags
 Mast
 IFace- ( local machine interface name)
Arp Flafs
C- Complete  entry
M- Permanent Entry
P-  Publish Entry
Configuration files:
/etc/net/arp
/etc/networks
/etc/hosts
/etc/ethers(contains 48 bit Ethernet addresses)

Syntax and examples:
# arp -a (to check the mac addrss reolved )
#arp -n
#arp -d <IP>/<MAC Addr>
to delete HW address
how to add MAC address to the IP
#arp -s <IP address> <MAC Address>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------if config comand---------------------------------------
# ifconfig -a (will display all the interface )
# ifconfig ens33(interface name) (will display the perticular inter face details)
we can also down the inter face by the fallowing command
# ifconfig docker0 down
To bring up the interface up
# ifconfig docker0 up 
we can change the mac address details to any interface, but physical hW will have thir own MAC
# ifconfig <dockero> hw ether 02:42:2f:50:03:1e
