Q. Difference bitween RHEL 6 & 7?
A. In RHEL6 maximum file system size=16TB (for 64bit Machine) and 8TB (for 32 bit machine). 
   While in RHEL7 maximum file system size is 500TB.
   #Refer Excel?
   In RHEL6 maximum file system size=16TB (for 64bit Machine) and 8TB (for 32 bit machine). While in RHEL7 maximum file system 
   size is 500TB. Also keep in mind that RHEL does not support XFS on 32-bit machines.
   
   RHEL 6 – Iptables by default service port is enabled when service is switched on. 
   RHEL 7 – Firewalld instead of iptables. Iptables can also support with RHEL 7, but we can't use both of them at the same 
   time. Firewall will not allow any port until and unless you enabled it.

Q. Difference bitween yum& RPM
A. yum: can install the packages available in its repository 
   RPM: can install multiple packages with the right file name
   ----------RPM-----------
RPM to install
# rpm -ivh <package name>
To check installed package under packages of mounted DVD(df -h)
# rpm -qa | grep <package name> 
To uninstall the package 
# rpm -ev <package name>
-----------yum----------
#yum -y install tree
#rpm -qa | grep tree ( to list the package is installedor not)

Q. Difference between Hard link and Soft link
A. Hard Link :
A hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected file. It accesses the data available in the original file.
  If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the 
  data of that file.

 Soft Link :
  A soft link (also known as Symbolic link) acts as a pointer or a reference to the file 
  name. It does not access the data available in the original file. If the earlier file is 
  deleted, the soft link will be pointing to a file that does not exist anymore.

Q. Difference between TCP/UDP?
A. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol. 
   A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. 
   Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, and efficient protocol, however, 
   retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Difference bitween find and locate?
A. Find:
   The find utility is a bit more aggressive than locate and which. The find utility will 
   return all the results that contain the keyword or string we have specified. 
   So when you search for a file with find command, it will return all files and 
   directories that contain the word.
Q. Locate:
   This utility performs a search through a previously created database of files and 
   directories available on our system. It matches all entries that contain a specified 
   character string. So before we can use the “locate” command we must first execute 
   the updatedb command to build a local database for each file within our filesystems 
   on Linux. This process usually takes a few seconds to complete.

Q. Difference bitween FTP(21),SFTP(22) NFS(2049), and SAMBA()?
   /etc/ssl/ftpc/ftpc. conf
   /etc/exports
   /etc/samba/smb.conf
A. Ftp: 
   stands for File Transfer Protocol which is used for transferring files from one 
   location to another location, normally using Internet. With FTP you can send very 
   big files. 
   SFTP(22):
   SFTP (or Secure File Transfer Protocol) is an alternative to FTP that also allows you to transfer 
   files, but adds a layer of security to the process. SFTP uses SSH (or secure shell) encryption to 
   protect data as it’s being transferred. This means data is not exposed to outside entities on the 
   Internet when it is sent to another party.
   NFS: (File level storage)
   stands for Network File system which allows a user to access a 
   file usually in a server. NFS is a file-sharing protocol that enables the users to access their clients' 
   files through a network, 
   File level storage, or file storage, is storage used for unstructured data and is commonly deployed 
   in Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems. It uses Network File System (NFS) for Linux, and 
   Common Internet File System (CIFS) or Server Message Block (SMB) protocols for Windows.
   Samba:
   is a software that enables not only sharing 
   of files but also sharing of printers.
   (i) Samba supports to all O/S platforms, whereas NFS will support the same platforms only.
   (ii) There is a security in Samba because Samba requires authentication, whereas in 
        NFS there is no security if there is no kerberos because NFS does not requires 
		authentication.
   (iii)Samba will support printer sharing, whereas NFS will not support printer sharing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. where do we use block storage or file storage?
A. Block storage is popular as a networking architecture used by enterprises for business-critical 
   applications, while file storage is ideal for data sharing within small teams
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Diference bitween layer 2 and layer 3 switches?
A.Layer 2 Switch:(data link layer)
   -Works with MAC address only 
   -it can communicate with single private network
   -Unmanaged switches
   -most famelier with Ethernet, means devices in a ethernet network are identified by MAC
  Layer 3 Switch(network layer)
   -Can perform functioning of both 2 layer and 3 layer switch
   -it can communicate with different private networks by configuring VLAN.
   -it is network layer and protocall is internet protocol
   -Layer 3 switches are managing routing table
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. can we replace layer 3 switch as a router?
A. it is not recommended to replace a router with layer 3 switch, but you can apply them in the same network at the same 
   time.
   A layer 3 switch is both a switch and a router: it can be regarded as a router 
   with multiple Ethernet ports and with switching function. layer 3 switch 
   enable packets switching by inspecting both their IP addresses and their MAC addresses.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Difference bitweentn SMTP and SNMP?
A. SNMP and SMTP are two standards that work together in harmony to achieve two 
   different tasks. They work in such a way that one can control SMTP servers and MTAs 
   through SNMP Managers. Further, SNMP Managers are capable of sending alerts through 
   SMTP mail servers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Difference botween telnet and ssh?
A. Telnet transfers the data in simple plain text. On other hand SSH uses Encrypted 
   format to send data and also uses a secure channel. No authentication or privileges 
   are provided for user's authentication. As SSH is more secure so it uses public key 
   encryption for authentication
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What are the differences between MAC and IP addresses?
A. MAC:
   * It is a permanent address. So we cannot change this address
   * It stands for Media Access Control Address. 
   * It is a physical address
   IP Address:
   * It is a temporary address. So, we can change this address any no. of times.
   * nternet Protocol address.
   * It is a logical address
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.  What is the difference between incremental and differential backup?
A.  Incremental backup :
    Taking a backup from the last full backup or last incremental backup
    Differential backup :
    Taking a backup from last full backup or last cumulative or differential backup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the basic difference between private disk group and shared disk group?
A. Private disk group :
    The disk group is only visible for the host on which we have created it. If the host is a part of the cluster, the 
    private disk group will not be visible to the other cluster nodes.
   Shared disk group :
    The disk group is sharable and visible to the other cluster nodes.
